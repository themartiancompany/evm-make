# Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Make

Make (build and install) tool for applications
developed using
[LibEVM](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/libevm)
and the EVM toolchain.

```bash
  evm-make \
    -h
```

It depends on
[Solidity Compiler](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/solidity-compiler)
to generate applications' integrated contracts artifacts.

## Installation

The program in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

EVM Make has been officially published on the
the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
user repository and application store as
`evm-make`.
The source code is published on the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
so it can't possibly be taken down.

To install it from there just type

```bash
ur \
  evm-make
```

A censorable HTTP Github mirror of the recipe published there,
containing a full list of the software dependencies needed to run the
tools is hosted on
[evm-make-ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-contracts-tools-ur).
Be aware the mirror could go offline any time as Github and more
in general all HTTP resources are inherently unstable and censorable.
